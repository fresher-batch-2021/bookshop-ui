            <p>About the Book :
        </strong>
        Against majority opinion within his profession, Donald Bloxham argues that it is legitimate, often unavoidable,
        and frequently important for historians to make value judgements about the past. History and Morality draws on a
        wide range of historical examples, and its author's insights as a
        practicing historian. Examining concepts like impartiality, neutrality, contextualisation, and the use and abuse
        of the idea of the past as a foreign country, Bloxham's book investigates how far tacit moral judgements infuse
        works of history, and how strange those histories would look if the
        judgements were removed. The author argues that rather than trying to eradicate all judgemental elements from
        their work, historians need to think more consistently about how, and with what justification, they make the
        judgements that they do. The importance of all this lies not just in the
        responsibilities that historians bear towards the past - responsibilities to take historical actors on those
        actors' own terms and to portray the impact of those actors' deeds - but also in the role of history as a source
        of identity, pride, and shame in the present. The account of moral thought in
        History and Morality has ramifications far beyond the activities of vocational historians.</p>
