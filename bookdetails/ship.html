        <strong><p>About the Book :</strong>
     At the heart of Ship of Sorrows is a group of young friends, men and women, Hindu and Muslim, living in Lucknow on the cusp of Indian Independence.
Like the rest of the country, their lives are in turmoil.As the certainties of an old order begin fraying and the prospect of division becomes inevitable, 
they are confronted with having to make the kind of decisions that their hitherto carefree, privileged lives had not required.
 Qurratulain Hyder places the six friends in situations that reflect this changing context and reveal their complex relationships with each other and with 
 their altered reality.As the partition of the country looms, and their separation from each other and from their known worlds becomes imminent, their cargo of sorrows gets heavier.
