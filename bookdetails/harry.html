            <h2>Harry Potter and the Cursed Child</h2>
            <p>
                It was always difficult being Harry Potter and it isn't much easier now that he is an overworked employee of
                the Ministry of Magic, a husband, and father of three school-age children.
                While Harry grapples with a past that refuses to stay where it belongs, his youngest son, Albus, must
                struggle with the weight of a family legacy he never wanted. As past and present fuse ominously,
                both father and son learn the uncomfortable truth: Sometimes, darkness comes from unexpected places.
                The playscript for Harry Potter and the Cursed Child was originally released as a -special rehearsal
                edition- alongside the opening of Jack Thorne's play in London's West End in summer 2016. Based on an
                original story by J.K. Rowling, John Tiffany, and Jack Thorne, the play opened to rapturous reviews from
                theatergoers and critics alike, while the official playscript became an immediate global bestseller.
