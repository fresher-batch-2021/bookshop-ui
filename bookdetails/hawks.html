        <strong><p>About the Book :</strong>
         The early 1980s: A fiery preacher has outgrown his mentors and is raising an army of radicalized young men across Punjab. 
         In Moranwale village, young Fareed is emerging from adolescence, uncertain about his future in an increasingly divided and violent society, 
         where neither love nor hope can survive. In Delhi, Sikand, a journalist approaching middle age, struggles to keep a grip on his life even as news 
         from the land of his childhood becomes alarming.
