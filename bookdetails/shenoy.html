            <strong><p>About the Book : </strong>

            Sometimes, a journey back is a step forward.

            When 26-year-old Ayan is sent to live with his grumpy old grandfather Gopal Shanker, in a tiny village, in
            Kerala, he is understandably devastated. What can a sleepy, idyllic village without even Internet
            connectivity
            offer a young man?

            To make matters worse, Jairaj, Ayan?s domineering father has his own plans and is determined to have his
            way.
            Soon, Ayan has to come to terms with the hard realities of life and the blindness of greed as he and Gopal
            Shanker learn that life can sometimes unravel in unanticipated ways.
