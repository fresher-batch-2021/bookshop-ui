      <p> On April 7, 1770, William Wordsworth was conceived in Cockermouth, Cumbria, England. Wordsworth's mom kicked the bucket when he was eightâ€”this experience shapes a lot of his later work. 
          Wordsworth went to Hawkshead Grammar School, where his adoraton for verse was solidly settled and, it is trusted, he made his initially endeavors at verse. 
        While he was at Hawkshead, Wordsworth's dad passed on abandoning him and his four kin vagrants.</p>
